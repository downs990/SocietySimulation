# Overview
The purpose of this simulation is to figure out how to build a utopian society. This society should be able to sustain a balanced state without conflict or disease for multiple generations once it has reached the status of a Utopia. Also, if a random societal interruption (S.I.) is added to the simulation it must be able to quickly (within weeks) regain a state of complete balance. The program will be easily configurable to model a society with specified environmental characteristics and common personality traits of individuals. 

A secondary objective for this project is to observe how a society evolves over multiple generations and log how they develop unique traits and norms based on random historic events.
